This example demonstrates how to interface fortran code with python using f2py.
When python is slow, or your algo uses loops and if statements, it can be useful to
farm off the slow piece of code to fortran.

example_watermass.py computes the volume of ocean water masses between different
temperature bounds.

Obtaining data from World Ocean Atlas:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>>> make getdata

Running the example:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>>> make run
