This example demonstrates how Fortran90 can be useful to perform
large analysis on a great number of output files. 
(Raf Dussin)

For cases where your analysis software (python, matlab,...) cannot fit into memory
the whole content of the data you need to compute a diagnostic, or is slow to perform,
it is useful to write a fortran tool to compute this diag and write the result into a file.

compute_mean_Tsquared.f90 compute the time-averaged T*T from a list of ROMS output files.
Rather than loading the whole data from all files, then putting it to the square then averaging
over the time axis, we break down the problem into smaller chunks that fit into memory and keep
the number of files opened at any given time limited to 2.
