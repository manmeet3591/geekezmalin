This example demonstrate how you can use Fortran90 to 
integrate in time a simple 2d diffusion equation.
(Raf Dussin)

It shows how to :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* perform a simple Euler time stepping, within its stability range
* use halos around the computation domain
* compute the laplacian with the simple 5 points stencil
* read parameters from namelist
* output the results in a netcdf file
* write a Makefile and namelist

Requires :
~~~~~~~~~~

* GNU make 
* fortran compiler
* netcdf library

Makefile is written for gfortran but can be adapted for any
other compiler (intel, pgi,...)

Using the example:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To compile code and run it:

>>> make run

To compile only:

>>> make

then run:

./diffusion2d namelist

To clean executable:

>>> make clean

To clean results:

rm tracer_diffusion_2d.nc
